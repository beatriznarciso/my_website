description: I worked at KPMG for two years after graduating from university. However, I was feeling something I was missing, and I needed a new challenge. Living in Seoul showed me the importance of having different international experiences. I'm very happy to have made the decision of moving to London and pursuing a career in what I consider to be the financial centre of Europe. I can't help but being contantly amzed by evverything London has to offer and how being a student in this city is so much fun. Not to mention, of course, how much I'm enjoying the masters I'm doing!
