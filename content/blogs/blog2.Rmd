description: Nothing better than a good movie with some nice popcorn, especially on a rainy day which as we all know we get a lot in London. That being sad, let's take a look on the ratings between to of the greatest movie directors of all time.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful:
```{r}
S_directors <- movies %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(rating), 
            sd = sd(rating), 
            count = n(),
            tstat = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se = sd/sqrt(count),
            lower_ci = avg - tstat*se, 
            upper_ci = avg + tstat*se) 
S_directors

ggplot(S_directors, aes(x = avg,
                        y = reorder(director, avg), 
                        color = director)) +
  
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_ci, 
                    xmax = upper_ci), 
                width = 0.1) +
  
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB Ratings",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB Rating",
       y = "") +
  
  geom_text(aes(label=round(lower_ci,2)), 
            vjust=-1.5,
            hjust=3,
