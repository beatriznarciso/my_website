description: I was born and raised in Lisbon, which we call the city of seven hills. Contantly sunny, with amazing food and incredible places to visit, i grew up to be passionate about my city, and to enjoy it as much as possible. I love to run alongside the Tejo river, to have a coffee in of the many coffes in Chiado, to shop at Saldanha, swim at the beaches in Cascais and have a nice picnic in Monsanto. It's definetly a visitation destiny i would recommend and I'm more than available to give you the best tips!
