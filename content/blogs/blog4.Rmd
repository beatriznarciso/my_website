description: I was born and raised in Lisbon, which we call the city of seven hills. Contantly sunny, with amazing food and incredible places to visit, i grew up to be passionate about my city, and to enjoy it as much as possible. I love to run alongside the Tejo river, to have a coffee in of the many coffes in Chiado, to shop at Saldanha, swim at the beaches in Cascais and have a nice picnic in Monsanto. It's definetly a visitation destiny i would recommend and I'm more than available to give you the best tips!

I was born in 19th of June of 1998 in Lisbon, Portugal. I come from an amazing, very loud, very typical portuguese family. Furthermore, something that I'm very grateful and feel fortunate was to live surrounded by inspiring and independent women who paved the way for me to grow up knowing the world is my playground and I, alongside with hard work and commitment, could be successful in whatever I decided I wanted to do. In highschool i did all the very comlicated classes such as biology, math chmistry and physics because i though i wanted to be a doctor. Fortunately i saw the light and made a last minute decision to pursue a management degree.
