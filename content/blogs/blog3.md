description: On my last year at university I chose to do a semeste abroad in Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is an energetic city, full of life and places to explore. Even after five months there I sill left with a feeling that there was still so much to see. Even though it may seem like my time spent in Asia was short, I have rooted in me small details of the Korean culture. I have K-pop songs in all my playlists. I’m addicted to Korean noodles and I a strongly defend the theory that soy sauce goes well with every plate. 
I was able to visit the east, west, south and north of the country by making small trips during the weekends. Every city was different and special in its own way. The common thread around the country, was the generosity, sympathy and humility of the Korean people. Koreans have such a heartwarming culture that as soon as I landed, even though I was halfway across the world, I immediately felt at home.I have learned to be more gentle and helpful to those around me by living among them. The Koreans have a lot of pain and are still marked by their dark past. They are worried about the constant uncertain of their country’s future, but they still manage to be the most cheerful persons I met.
