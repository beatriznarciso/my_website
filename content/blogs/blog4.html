description: I was born and raised in Lisbon, which we call the city of seven hills. Constantly sunny, with amazing food and incredible places to visit, I grew up to be passionate about my city and to enjoy it as much as possible. I love to run alongside the Tejo river, to have a drink in of the many coffes shops in Chiado, to shop at Saldanha, swim at the beaches in Cascais and have a nice picnic in Monsanto. It is definetly a visitation destiny I would recommend and I'm more than available to give you the best tips!

<p>I was born in 19th of June of 1998 in Lisbon, Portugal. I come from an amazing, very loud, very typical Portuguese family. Furthermore, something that Iâ€™ve alwasy felt very grateful and fortunate was to live surrounded by inspiring and independent women who paved the way for me to grow up knowing the world is my playground and I, alongside with hard work and commitment, could be successful in whatever I decided I wanted to do. In high school I did all the very complicated classes such as Biology, Math, Chemistry and Physics because I though I wanted to be a doctor. Fortunately I saw the light and made a last minute decision to pursue a management degree.In my last year of university I did an exchange semester in Seoul, South Korea. It was an amazing experience that has defined a lot of who I am. After that, I worked for two years at KPMG before joining LBS.
Apart from all my academic/professional experiences, I consider myself to be a very passionate and enthusiastic person who enjoys a good challenge. Outside the walls of Sussex Place or Sammy Offer I have a hate-love relationship with jogging, I love to travel, I am the biggest foodie and I do everything while listening to music!</p>
